Islandora Drupal Servlet Filter

Description
===========

This is the servlet filter to permit the Fedora Commons repository software to authenticate against a Drupal database. Both FeSL (JAAS) and non-FeSL authentication schemes are supported with the same .jar file.

For help with configuring the Drupal filter see the servlet_filter_README.txt file in the Islandora download distribution.

Anonymous Users
===============
Fedora requires a username for the audit trail so we populate a username of anonymous for empty user names.

Building
========

This project uses Maven and specifies Fedora as a dependency.  To build the servlet filter simply run the command:

$ mvn install

This can take a few minutes as Maven will need to download and build Fedora before it can build the Drupal filter.

To remove traces of the build process, run:

$ mvn clean

The target/ directory is in the .gitignore file as it is bad practise to check binary files into Git that are created with a build process.
